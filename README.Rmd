## Overview

mortyr is an R wrapper to the [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)
and the most rickdiculous package in the R-verse. Use it to return information
about your favourite characters, locations, and episodes from the show.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MikeJohnPage/mortyr")
```
## Usage

```{r, eval = TRUE}

mortyr::get_characters()
```

## Rate limit

The Rick and Morty API is an open API, no authentication is required for use. Nonetheless, to prevent malicious usage of the API there is a limit on the number of requests a given IP address can make. This limit is 10000 requests per day. If you happen to hit the limit you'll receive a 429 status (Too Many Requests) on all your requests during a period of 12 hours.

## Getting help

If you encounter a clear bug, please file a minimal reproducible example in [issues](https://github.com/MikeJohnPage/mortyr/issues).
