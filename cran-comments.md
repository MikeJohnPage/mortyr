## Submission

policy violation was 'On Internet access'. In this release I have:

* Remedied the policy violation by fixing a bug that was causing all of the
`get_*()` functions in this package to return an error when calling 'The Rick
and Morty' API.

## Test environments
* local macOS 10.16, R 4.0.3
* Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS (on travis-ci), R 4.0.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
